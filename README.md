# Kidney-Disease-Detection
Project Description:
The Kidney Disease Detection project aims to build a reliable and efficient machine learning model that can predict the presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients based on various medical attributes. Early detection of kidney disease is crucial as it can help prevent progression to end-stage renal failure and improve patient outcomes.

This project uses a supervised learning approach where clinical data is collected and preprocessed to build predictive models. The dataset contains information about several critical features such as blood pressure, specific gravity, albumin levels, blood urea, serum creatinine, hemoglobin, and more. These features are strong indicators used by medical professionals to diagnose kidney conditions.

The workflow of the project includes:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, converting categorical variables to numerical format, normalization, and feature selection.

Model Building: Applying and comparing different classification algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

Model Evaluation: Evaluating models based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to determine the best-performing classifier.

Result Interpretation: Analyzing the significance of each feature and how it influences the prediction to ensure explainability and trust in the model.

The goal of this project is to assist healthcare professionals by providing a data-driven support system that can help in early and accurate diagnosis. Although this version runs in a notebook environment and does not have a user interface, it lays the foundation for future deployment in clinical decision-making tools or integration into healthcare platforms.
