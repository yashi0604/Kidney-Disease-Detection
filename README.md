# Kidney-Disease-Detection
Project Description:
This project involves the development of a machine learning model to predict the presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) based on medical parameters. By analyzing patient data such as blood pressure, creatinine levels, hemoglobin, albumin, and other clinical features, the model assists in early detection of kidney disorders.

The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values and normalized for optimal performance. Several classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest were trained and evaluated. The best-performing model was then integrated into a user-friendly interface for real-time prediction.

Key Features:
Data cleaning and preprocessing

Model training and evaluation

Accuracy, precision, and recall analysis

Frontend interface for user input and prediction

Early disease detection to assist medical professionals

Tools & Technologies:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

HTML/CSS for frontend (if web interface is used)

Flask/Streamlit (optional) for backend integration
